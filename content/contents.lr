This site is for showcasing my current work. As I work on new projects, this will be updated to reflect my ability. Old projects may be taken down over time - to check those out visit my github at http://troyleak.github.com

This site is built with [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
