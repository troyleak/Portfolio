Hi, I'm Troy Leak

I make stuff.

I'm a programmer, tech geek, and outdoors enthusiast from Southern California.

I use Python to create apps and analyze information. I'm currently a student at Palomar College in San Diego, studying to become a full-stack developer.

In my spare time, I like to game or go play outside.
